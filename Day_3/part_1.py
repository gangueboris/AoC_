Goal: add up all part numbers

A part number is a number which is adjacent even in diagonal to a symbol.
NB: '.' is not considered like a symbol.

Approch:
- Browse the input in goal to find a number
- if number find, generate neighbbour table and explore around
- if we meet in the exploration something different than '.' && !isdigit(grid[r][c]) and up the number to res
 

input:
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..

1. use the algorithm of flood filling
