# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code (AoC_) ðŸŽ„
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event running from December 1st to 25th, where two problems are proposed each day. You must solve the first problem to unlock the second.

Each day, the difficulty of the problems increases.

I practice AoC problems to enhance my skills in new programming languages and, most importantly, to improve my problem-solving abilities.

- Python: AoC_22, AoC_23
- C++ : AoC_24
